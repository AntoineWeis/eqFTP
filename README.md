### [Help with translations!](https://github.com/Equals182/eqFTP/wiki/1.6-Frequently-Asked-Questions#how-can-i-translate-this-extension-to-language-of-my-people)

FTP client for Brackets code editor.

Here's some features:

* FTP File Manager -- You can explore remote server
* Downloading -- On double click you can download file to edit
* Uploading -- You can upload files on save
* FTP Connection Manager -- You can manage all your connections in single window
* Queue -- You can queue lots of files and then upload them with one click.

This extension created on base of [Brackets FTP](https://github.com/theproducer/brackets-ftp). Actually I rewrote almost everything, but still. 
Inspired by Dreamweaver's FTP implementation. First you create new connection in manager, next you connect, download file, edit, save and it's uploads automatically.

It's really basic and I hope you'll enjoy this extension. [Click here for more information](https://github.com/Equals182/eqFTP/wiki)

**This extension is SO fresh so please use it carefully, and if you find a bug [create an issue now](https://github.com/Equals182/eqFTP/issues/new)**

## What's Next

Well first of all I'd like to say I did this extension because I needed it. I will add new features if I'll need them or if you will pull request them.

You can fork this stuff and change it however you want.

I'm thinking about this:

* SFTP -- IT'S GOING TO BE NEXT BIG THING HERE WAIT FOR IT
* Sync -- like REAL sync (gotta figure it out)
* Open only readable by Brackets files (extension)
* Auto-moving all projects from old default directory to new
* Creating files on remote server

## Version History

>Please don't kick my ass for updating extension so often. I just want to fix every bug that was found.
>
>If I fix something critical I throw update on registry and for that I need to increase version number (I'm trying to follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)). If update is too minor and it's not critical enough for extension work, I'll just wait till it get bigger or till weekends.
